                    <h2>Motivation: Dog's Tail</h2>
                    <p>ML problem: make a dog friendly (TODO happy dog with tail image)</p>
                    <p>you have a dataset of dogs' features: color, breed, size, wagging its tail, friendliness</p>
                    <p>regression shows that tail wagging is the most important feature to predict friendliness</p>
                    <p>you decide to manually wag this dog's tail (TODO "no you sit! - okay" meme image)</p>
                    <p>YOU DIED</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Motivation: Demand vs. Price</h2>
                    <p>you have historical sales: prices and quantity sold</p>
                    <p>you need to find find a price that maximizes total revenue</p>
                    <p>you build a model with price among other features and quantity sold as target</p>
                    <p>you find out that higher price leads to more sales</p>
                    <p>&hellip;</p>
                    <p>NO PROFIT, because low prices and low sales were there during crisis, and high prices and high sales happended during economic bloom</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Causation</h2>
                    <p>there is something that you can't find out given the historical data alone</p>
                    <p>you need to know that beforehand (domain knowledge) or run an experiment</p>
                    <p>kids learn that hard way (have you tried to wag dog's tail?)</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Causal questions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Estimating the treatment effect on a population</li>
                        <li>Which treatment to choose for a patient</li>
                        <li>How much we would sell if we set price to X?</li>
                        <li>How much money your model deployment could bring?</li>
                        <li>Does X cause Y?</li>
                        <li>What if &hellip;?</li>
                        <li>And the most important question: will a dog be happy if we pet it?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>this doesn't look like a typical supervised ML problem</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Definition</h2>
                    <p>T causes Y iff changing T leads to a change in Y, keeping everything else constant.</p>
                    TODO find source of it (Pearl 2009: 70)?

                    <h2>Rubin Causal Model</h2>
                    <p>is about potential outcomes (in a world that doesn't exist)</p>
                    <p>If an hour ago I had taken two aspirins instead of just a glass of water, my headache would now be gone</p>
                    <p>No causation without manipulation</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h2>Randomized Controlled Trials</h2>
                    <p>(more known for Internet audience as AB-tests)</p>
                    <p>gold standard for answering causal questions</p>
                    <ul>have some problems:
                        <li>only average population effect</li>
                        <li>small sizes</li>
                        <li>non-compliance</li>
                        <li>dropout</li>
                        <li>small scale, difficult to generalize</li>
